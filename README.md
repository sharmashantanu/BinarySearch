# BinarySearch

With this program, users are able to find whether an element exists in an array and at which index.
Users can input the size of the array they want to create and then enter the elements one by one.
Once all the elements are inserted, the array is displayed in it's raw format, unsorted. Then the user is informed
that in order to use the binary search algorithm the array needs to be sorted and they are asked to choose how it should be;
in ascending or descending order. Depending the user's choice a sequence of functions is triggered and the user is asked for
a last input regarding the element they want to find. If the element is found, the program terminates while if the element is not found there is a recursive call to the method that takes care of this functionality until an existent number is entered.
